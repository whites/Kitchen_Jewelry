# Kitchen Jewelry Classfier

In this small case, I trained a classfier to predicts the category from the product title, rating and review text. The data is loaded from multiple files and integrated on same 'id', after that, actions like removing duplications and correct errors are conducted.

LogisticRegression is selected as machine learning model.
